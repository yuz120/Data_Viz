data visualization projects

The clock.js file contains the code for my first data visualization project: a visualized clock without the traditional hour, minute and second hands. Relying on the geometric shapes, the viewer could see the change of second through the rotation of the star. Then, each alteration of the minute, the triangle will change into a random, different color, and meanwhile it rotates in certain angle. 

Finally, the semicircle stands for the "hour". For each change of the hour, one additional small semicircle would be accumulated to the chain down below. The number of small semicircles represent the number of hours. 

The time is based on the local time zone of the viewers or users. 

The website

hosts the live version of the clock.
